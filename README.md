# Description

A simple Pomodoro Chrome Extension built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is used to improve productivity and focus by allowing you to work in short, focused bursts.

# Settings

The Pomodoro Extension allows you to customize the timer settings to suit your needs. You can set the length of the work interval, the length of the short break, and the length of the long break. You can also choose to enable or disable the sound notification when the timer is up.
